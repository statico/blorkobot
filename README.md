# BlorkoBot

BlorkoBot is an unofficial bot for [MeshCore](https://github.com/meshcore-dev/MeshCore), the mesh radio protocol. It's a Python "fanout" plugin for [Remote Terminal for MeshCore](https://github.com/nicholasgasior/Remote-Terminal-for-MeshCore) plus a Node.js alert server, originally built for Bay Area MeshCore by Blorko and 100% coded with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code).

It responds in channels like **#bot**, **#test**, **#path**, **DMs**, and select topic channels (**#weather**, **#earthquake**, **#fire**, **#space**).

> **Note:** This is **not** the exact version of BlorkoBot running on [bayareameshcore.org](https://bayareameshcore.org). API keys, channel keys, content filter words, and a few region-specific bits have been blanked out so the source can be public. You'll need to fill these in for your own deployment. See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for setup notes.

## Files

- **`bot.py`** — Fanout plugin for Remote Terminal. Handles all `!` commands and DM path replies.
- **`server.ts`** — Long-running Node.js server. Polls external services (USGS quakes, NWS weather alerts, CAL FIRE, NOAA SWPC, PG&E outages, RSS) and posts to MeshCore channels. Also logs telemetry.

## Getting Started

Send `!help` to BlorkoBot in #bot, #test, or a DM to see available commands. Commands start with `!`.

Send `!dm` in a channel and BlorkoBot will send you a direct message with path/hop info — useful for testing your mesh connectivity. In DMs, BlorkoBot also replies with path/hop information for any message.

## Automatic Alerts

The `server.ts` companion process posts automatic alerts to dedicated channels:

- **#earthquake** — Earthquakes M2.5+ in a configurable bounding box (from [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov))
- **#weather** — NWS weather alerts for configured zones (from [NWS API](https://api.weather.gov)). Same event types are rate-limited to avoid spam.
- **#fire** — Active California wildfires (from [CAL FIRE](https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents))
- **#space** — Solar flares (M-class+) and geomagnetic storms (Kp 5+) (from [NOAA SWPC](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov))
- **#power** — PG&E power outages (500+ customers) with city location (from [PG&E](https://www.pge.com))
- **#alert** — Aggregated firehose of all of the above
- **#bot** / **#alert** — New posts from a configured RSS feed

These are pushed automatically — no commands needed. Just join the channel.

## Topic Channels

BlorkoBot also responds to relevant commands in topic channels:

| Channel | Commands |
|---------|----------|
| **#weather** | `!weather` `!wc` `!forecast` `!fcc` `!sun` `!tide` `!surf` `!alerts` `!aqi` `!wave` |
| **#earthquake** | `!quake` `!quakes` `!earthquake` `!earthquakes` |
| **#fire** | `!fire` `!fires` `!wildfire` |
| **#space** | `!space` `!solar` `!swx` `!flare` `!hf` |
| **#path** | `!path` `!pathx` `!pathall` `!patha` `!longpath` `!bigpath` `!ping` `!test` `!dm` `!stats` |

Only the listed commands work in each topic channel. Use **#bot** or **#test** for the full command set.

## Tips

- Location-based commands require a location (e.g., `!weather sf`). Shortcuts: **"sf"** = San Francisco, **"sj"** = San Jose, **"sfo"** = SFO airport.
- Messages are limited by mesh radio constraints (~120 bytes), so responses are kept short. Long responses may be split across multiple messages (up to 3).
- In DMs, any non-command message returns path/hop info — great for testing connectivity.

## Setup

1. Install and run [Remote Terminal for MeshCore](https://github.com/nicholasgasior/Remote-Terminal-for-MeshCore) — it listens on `http://127.0.0.1:4042` by default.
2. Create a fanout plugin in Remote Terminal pointing at `bot.py`, or PATCH the source in via the API (see [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)).
3. Fill in API keys in `bot.py` (`_N2YO_KEY`, `_BAY511_API_KEY`, `_GROQ_KEY`, `_AERODATABOX_KEY`). Commands degrade gracefully when keys are missing.
4. Fill in the channel keys at the top of `server.ts` for the channels you want alerts posted to, and adjust `QUAKE_BBOX` and `NWS_ZONES` for your region.
5. Run `server.ts` with `node --experimental-strip-types --env-file=.env --watch server.ts`.

## How some things are counted

### `!2byte` / `!stats` — repeater hash width

MeshCore repeaters can be configured to use 1-, 2-, or 3-byte path prefixes when they relay adverts. Wider prefixes reduce collisions but take up more room in each packet. Rolling that number up across a mesh is a decent proxy for how far along a network is on the "moving to 2-byte prefixes" migration.

Remote Terminal exposes an `/api/contacts/repeaters/advert-paths` endpoint that returns, per repeater, the recent advert paths it has seen. Each path has a hex string and a hop count. Bytes per hop = `len(path_hex) / 2 / path_len` — and because a repeater always encodes hop entries in its own `PATH_HASH_SIZE`, that number tells you the repeater's setting.

The naive version — "look at the single most recent advert" — undercounts 2-byte repeaters for two reasons:

1. A repeater's most recent advert may happen to be its single 1-byte edge case (or the path stored for it wasn't the most useful sample). Some repeaters emit adverts with different bph values over time.
2. Repeaters that were heard once six months ago on 1-byte firmware and never again still count as "1-byte" even if they've since upgraded or died.

`_count_repeater_types()` fixes both:

- Ask for up to **20 recent adverts per repeater** and take the **max** bytes-per-hop seen. If a repeater ever emitted a 2-byte advert in that window, it's 2-byte-capable.
- Ignore any repeater whose most recent advert is more than **30 days** old.

Both refinements come from studying [CoreScope](https://github.com/Kpa-clawbot/CoreScope)'s approach, which reads the hash size directly from packet header bits and takes a running max across everything it's seen. We can't read raw header bits from the Remote Terminal API, but the derived bytes-per-hop is equivalent when the path is well-formed.

### `!pathx` — extended path with repeater names

MeshCore path hops are prefixes of a repeater's public key (usually 1 or 2 bytes). Multiple repeaters can share a prefix, so turning a path back into a list of names is a disambiguation problem. `_resolve_path_hops()` in `bot.py` works in four layers, each only used if the previous can't decide:

1. **Adjacency** — if a candidate has a confirmed neighbor edge to an already-resolved hop (or to the sender/receiver at the ends), it wins.
2. **Shared neighbors** — a candidate whose neighbor set overlaps the path's resolved pubkeys is more likely to be on the path.
3. **GPS interpolation** — with the sender and receiver as anchors, interpolate an expected location for each remaining hop and pick the closest candidate.
4. **Last seen** — tiebreaker for the recently-heard candidate.

Layers 1 and 2 commit only on decisive evidence (best score ≥ 3× second-best), so thin evidence falls through to GPS rather than over-committing. Adjacency and neighbor data are precomputed by `server.ts` from the recent packet history and dumped to a JSON cache the bot reloads on mtime change.

This is adapted from CoreScope's disambiguation gate — the specific thresholds and the layer ordering match theirs.
